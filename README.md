This is a database system.
You will first be asked to store or see the database.
If you store you will be asked to select the index where you want to store.
You can keep on storing as much as you like.
If you want to see you can either see all data or see the data of any student by inserting their index.
All the data is stored in a file named record.txt in the directory of same file.
